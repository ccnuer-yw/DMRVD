# DMRVD(dual-modal raster-vector dataset)
Among them, each modality image is in the 'master' branch.
#
We present the first deep-learning-based DMRVD for super-resolution-fusion-based terraced field vectorization extraction(TFVE). DMRVD provides cross-modal and cross-scale super-resolution features, enabling advanced applications in TFVE.
DMRVD covers a total area of approximately 7,863 km² across three regions: Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province; Qiaojia County and Ludian County, Yunnan Province, China with 10,000 remotely sensed imageries, 10,000 DEMs and 42,040 vectorized polygons. 
#
The dataset can be partitioned into training, testing and validation sets as needed, according to specific requirements.
# Next Step
Stay informed, the ΩSFormer code will soon be released.
