# DMRVD(dual-modal raster-vector dataset)
Among them, each modality image is in the 'master' branch.
#
This study presents the first deep-learning-based DMRVD for super-resolution-fusion-based terraced field vectorization extraction(TFVE). This dataset provides cross-modal and cross-scale super-resolution features, enabling advanced applications in TFVE.
# Next Step
Stay informed, the ΩSFormer code will soon be released.
